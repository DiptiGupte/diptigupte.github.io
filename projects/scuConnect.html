                        <h4>Testing Results</h4>
                        <p><span class="bolded">After completing the first iteration of high-fiedelity prototypes, my team and I tested our app on some of our other classmates.</span> During the
                            testing, we had one facilitator talking to the participant to explain the concept of the app, go over the tasks that the participant was going to do
                            and answer any questions. The other two teammates were scribes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After all the rounds of testing, we went over the notes and discussed how to update our app to incorporate the feedback we had received.
                            <span class="bolded">We found</span> that we <span class="bolded">needed to add a logo and application name to add information that allows the user to ask "what am I getting into?"". Contacts
                            and rooms were not clearly separated,</span> so we needed to make it clearer for the user to understand, as users tested were confused as to how
                            contacts and schedules are separated. In addition, <span class="bolded">the target audience seemed too broad</span>, so we switched to focus towards Santa Clara
                            University students and faculty rather than any student or teacher.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Final Design</h4>
                        <p>For the final design, I <span class="bolded">updated the app's color scheme</span> to make Santa Clara University's school colors. I also took the feedback from the testing
                            and <span class="bolded">cleaned up the navigation bars</span> at the top and bottom of the screens. Lastly, I <span class="bolded">simplified the session creation screens.</span>

                        <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                        <p>From this project, I learned how to communicate the design ideas during the ideation phase and how to translate those ideas into the design of
                            the screens. Some things that I would improve on would be to simplify the design and clarify the purpose of the icons on the screens.
