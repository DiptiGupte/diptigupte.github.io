                            for a happy home life</span>. Quarmate is the helping hand that these college students are looking for.

                    <h4>Initial Concept</h4>
                    <p>The original idea was to create an <span class="bolded">app that kept track of when
                        common spaces were used and disinfected</span>. The app would also
                        keep track of a guest list, so that users could see who and when
                        their roommates had visitors.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Interviews</h4>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Our main goal in the interview process was to decide whether we wanted to pursue contact-tracing or cleaning functionality.</span> To conduct
                        interviews, our team split into groups of two, with one primary interviewer and one secondary interviewer/scribe. I participated in two
                        interviews so I could try out the role of both primary and secondary interviewer. We went into the interviews with two qualifying questions,
                        four potential follow-up questions, and eight topics that we wanted to try to bring up if it came about naturally during our time. After the
                        interview, the primary and secondary interviewer would do a progress review to go over the notes and add any important information. After the
                        whole group completed all the interviews,we got together to share our individual findings and synthesize our data into behavioral variables
                        and demographic variables. <span class="bolded">We found that most of our interviewees already had plans in place for cleaning and few had set ground rules for
                        hosting guests in their living spaces.</span> They also had no plan if a housemate or visitor tested positive for COVID.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Personas, Scenarios, & User Requirements</h4>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Using the information we got from the interviews and behavioral and demographic variables, the next step for our class was to create a primary
                        persona and a secondary persona and create a scenario and user requirements for each.</span> I worked with another teammate to create these
                        assignments for the primary persona, Emma Somers.We first worked together to decide how informed Emma is on COVID, quarantining and
                        the cleaning and visitor rules within her house. Then my partner and I split up the remaining tasks with me using the scenario that my partner
                        would create and extracting the corresponding user requi rements. <span class="bolded">Included below is a snippet of the user requirements, along with the
                        scenario it came from.</span>

                                test herself as often as necessary in the coming months, so it's a relief to see how mutable this setting in the app is! Since she's been tested recently and
                                received a negative result, Quarmate lets Emma know she's all cleared from the need to quarantine.

                                cleanliness. Particularly noting how Claire L. had forgotten to wipe surfaces in the dining room for the past few days, Emma sets the status to "needs cleaning"
                                and flags her profile for responsibility.

                    <h4>Implementation</h4>
                    <p>I worked with another teammate to write a design doc for a more detailed explanation of what we wanted our app to do and each screen we
                        planned on creating, using the system requirements as a reference. After that the team created an implementation plan to assign ourselves
                        roles and create a timeline of what we planned on completing for the next few weeks to have a functioning app to demo during the final week
                        of the quarter. <span class="bolded">I choose to work on the frontend implementation, with the first task being to create a high-fidelity prototype on Figma.</span>

                                <p>Our final project had three screens; the home profile, the user profile, and the visitor log. <span class="bolded">I was in charge of designing and coding the
                                    frontend for the home profile</span>,which stores a collection of housemates, a collection of rooms, a master list of chores with the person
                                    each item is assigned to, and a link for the user to send their roommates a request to have a visitor.

                                <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                                <p>From this project, I learned how to take the quantitative and qualitative data gained from the interviews, personas, scenarios, and others
                                    to design and code the minimum viable product. For the next iteration of this app, I would add a vaccination status to the profiles
                                    of the users and add a contact tracing feature for roommates and guests.
